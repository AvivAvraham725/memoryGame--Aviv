// What toDo ?

// 1. Empty Cards will show on opening page
// 2. Create a api for each category
// 3. When we choose a category, Create  a messege that the game will start (let's play (category) memoryGame).
// 4. Take data from api and create the basic logic(shuffle, take random items, create the cards from the api data)
// 5. Create a game logic (flip the cards, match the cards, disable the cards that are matched)
// 6. When the game is over, create a messege that the game is over (well done).
// 7. Create a reset button that will reset the game and all the cards.

// upgrades:
// 1. Add a timer?
